# Components

ESP-IDF uses the concept of "Components" for developing application in a modular way. More information about this can be found in https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/build-system.html (optional)

## MicroKWS Components

The only component used by the MicroKWS project except the `main` component is called `posterior`. It contains the to-be-implemented posterior handler for Lab 2. Read [`student/README.md`](student/README.md) for more details. The to-be-implemented sources are located separately from the `3_run/prj/components/` directory in `3_run/student/posterior` to be more accessible and referenced via relative paths.
